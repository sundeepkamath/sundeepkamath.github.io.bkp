<p>These days if you are looking for some <strong>web design templates</strong> for your web sites, there are so many options that you'll find online.<br />
Gone are the days when one would have to consult a web designer for these.<br />
Of course, you might still want to consult one for professional projects, however for all other cases as long as you have the basic <strong>familiarity</strong> with <strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> you should be able to find your way through with some effort.<br />
I've been recently working on a side project of mine, whereby I wanted to use some <strong>pre-designed</strong> web design templates.<br />
After searching around a bit on Google I found the following ones worth sharing...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/templates.html">HTML5 templates</a></p>

<ul>
<li>These have a nice set of basic HTML5 templates </li>
<li>The only criteria being you need to include a link to their website in the footer of your website (where you use these templates)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Free bootstrap themes</a></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are looking for bootstrap based themes, there are some interesting ones on this site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">Premium bootstrap themes</a></p>

<ul>
<li>These are mostly paid ones, but in many cases the professional themes that you get in return are well worth it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many more such sites available, these are good enough to start with.<br />
I'll update the above list if I come across any more such interesting links.<br />
If you have some interesting links or suggestions do drop by a comment.</p>
