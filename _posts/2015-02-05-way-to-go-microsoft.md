It’s been over a decade since the time Microsoft introduced **.Net** as a development platform and **Visual Studio** as an IDE.

I remember those days when I first worked with .Net 1.0. The rich IDE provided by Visual Studio and the rapid development features it provided was a hit with the developers.

Microsoft had introduced .Net as a technology stack which supported **multiple languages** and also **multiple platforms** (these were restricted to windows platforms).

Over the years .Net as a platform has evolved a lot and **C# as a language has evolved** all the more. One can fairly say that C# today has some very nice language constructs that are missing in Java and Java would need some catching up to do there  (though of course Java as a technology stack is far more mature with a lot of enterprise level frameworks available, a huge backing by the open community, some of this also because of its long head start.)

The one gripe that the .Net community had was that .Net was **not truly cross platform**. Its support was restricted to Windows platforms only. Java had a big advantage here as it provided cross platform support - be it windows, Linux, Mac, mobile etc. The **Mono team** attempted to change this to some extent by taking .Net cross platform.

There was limited adoption by the open source community as .Net was **closed source**. Moreover, the development tools from the Microsoft stable including Visual Studio IDE, SQL Server database etc. were licensed and not free for download.

This changed a few years ago with **express editions** of the IDE and the SQL Server database being made available for developer downloads. This was good but **not very convenient** what with one having to download a separate express edition of the IDE for each development environment example: web development, windows development etc. ….

The recent announcements from the Microsoft camp has changed all this….

These include…  

1. **Open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">.Net components</a>**  
* .Net core runtime (including CLR, JIT, GC and core .Net libraries)  
* .Net server side application stack including ASP.NET, EF, Web API, NuGet package manager and the “Roslyn” C# and VB compilers.  

2. **Bringing .Net core libraries to Linux and Mac**
* An official distribution of the core .Net libraries would be made available for both Linux and Mac platforms  
* With this development would be possible using .Net on both these platforms making .Net truly cross platform  

3. **Making Visual Studio Community Edition IDE available for download**  
  * A fully featured Visual Studio IDE with all the productivity features and IDE extensibility capabilities is available for <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">free download</a>  
  * This IDE is completely free for   
      a. Any individual developer working on a commercial or non-commercial project      
      b. Any developer contributing to an open source project  
      c. Anyone in an academic research or course setting (e.g. students, teachers, classroom, online course)      
      d. Any non-enterprise organization with 5 or fewer developers working on a commercial/non-commercial project together  
        

4. **Using Visual Studio IDE with <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> one can develop**  
    * mobile apps that target windows phones, IOS devices as well as android devices.  
    
5. **Mobile first, cloud first approach with the latest <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/">Windows 10 OS</a>**  
    * With this the OS will support a variety of devices right from mobile phones, tablets, phablets, desktops etc. with a cloud centric approach.  

I have just summarized a few of the recent announcements above, but I suggest you check out the following event videos/webcasts …  
* <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2014">Microsoft connect event 2014</a>  
* <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/">Windows 10</a>  

I think these are some really good decisions coming from the  Microsoft camp and will benefit the developer community a great deal.  

These are really exciting times for developers.  

I would love to hear your thoughts.
