Many a times before we actually start putting down an idea to code, we first create a rough draft. When it comes to designing the <strong>UI screens</strong>, it always helps to have some <strong>mock up reference</strong>.

If your like me who uses windows as a platform then, you are most likely to use MS Paint software to create a mockup if your not already familiar with the mockup editors readily available these days.

Using a mockup editor <strong>saves a lot of time</strong>, its very convenient and easy to use and it also makes the mockup look professional. There are a number of these mockup editors available these days both free and paid.

<a href="http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/">Balsamiq</a> is one such mockup software that’s very popular and easy to use. They have a trial version on their site. However its a paid software for most purposes.

Recently, I had to create a mockup for one of the projects I’m currently working on. I was looking for an easy to use mockup editor and something <strong>which was free to use</strong>.

I stumbled upon this wonderful editor <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn/">Pencil</a> which is free, open source and comes under the <strong>GPL license</strong>. One of the good things about this editor is that it is available for all three major OS platforms – <strong>Windows, Linux and Mac</strong>.

This tool comes bundled with quite a few nifty features out of the box.

It has <strong>built-in collections</strong> of numerous <strong>general-purpose</strong> shapes, <strong>flowchart </strong>elements, <strong>desktop/web</strong> UI shapes, <strong>Android </strong>and <strong>iOS GUI</strong> shapes.

I really like the way you can put up a <strong>wireframe </strong>for something like a wizard page with a multi-selection grid in it <strong>in no time</strong>...

Another nifty feature I find is the ability to <strong>draw flowchart like diagrams</strong> using connectors for linking like ...

Furthermore, it also provides a <strong>number of export formats</strong> for your mockup ...

I've been using it for some time now and its now an inherent part of my development toolkit.
It’s convenient to use and if you are a <strong>Firefox </strong>user an <strong>extension</strong> for the same is also available :)
I would also love to hear which mockup/UI prototyping tool you find indispensable!!!
