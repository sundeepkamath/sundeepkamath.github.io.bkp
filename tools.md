title: Software Craftsmanship Tools
---

Every developer has his/her own set of nifty tools that they cannot do without. I have my own collection of such utility tools that I find indispensable.
Here I'll be maintaining a list of all such tools that I love using during my day to day work as a software developer.
I would love to hear your opinions on these and any tools that you might want to recommend over the ones that I list here.

#### **Text editors**  

* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)   

	I've been using this editor from ages now and have found it to be one of the most flexible and feature rich editors. It comes with support for various plugins which I like the most about it. It is a free tool that runs only on the Windows platform.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
	
	This is the new kid on the block from the Microsoft stable. It's free and the best part is it supports  all the 3 platforms Windows, Linux and Mac. It also has inbuilt support for Markdown.

#### **IDEs**  

* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)  

	Well I find this to be one of the best IDEs out there if you are a .Net developer. I have used a few other IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ etc. While each of them offer their own unique and useful features, I find this IDE to be the best in terms of memory usage and performance.
